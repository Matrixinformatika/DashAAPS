# DashAAPS
Small App used for testing scenarios required for Omnipod Dash pods

## Note

Started work on small App, that can be later used for Dash or even Eros. For now this will 
contain only only small gui without any real code that could interact with Dash/Eros. 



## TODO

Phase 1:
+ TBR
+ Pod Expiration check (in Service)
+ Pod Expiration (Red color, for last 8 hours)
+ Reset Pod

Phase 2:
- copy files into DashCommApp
- reconfigure project to use DashCommApp

Phase 3:
- start PodCommManager integration with UI (PCMI)
- PCMI Bolus
- PCMI Cancel Bolus
- PCMI TBR
- PCMI Cancel TBR
- PCMI Init Pod
- PCMI Deactive Pod




Phase 3 (outside of this project probably)
- Basal Profile (Edit, Send to Pod) ???
- maybe InitPod wizard integration later (or maybe not)
